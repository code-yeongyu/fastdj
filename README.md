# What is FastDJ

FastDJ is a simple script that helps you to create your restful api django backend project easily.  
What you do with djangorestframework is pretty limited, therefore FastDJ offers some templates to do them quickly, and you can use them just with some modify at the settings file.  
You need to use python3 or later and the django 2.0 or later to use this script.

# What FastDJ offers

- making models
- automatically setting up virtualenv
- automatically installing required pip modules (django, djangorestframework, django-cors-headers)
- easier setups in settings.py ( simplify the setups about timezone, adding django_apps, restframework settings and cors-headers settings )
- setting up serializers
- making custom user model with templates
- limited templates about views
- auto url routing

# So do I have to use it?

You don't have to use it if you want high-customizable features.  
But you can write a restful api backend of a community service with 105 lines of settings file. Check it on the examples directory of this project.
